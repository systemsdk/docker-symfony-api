## Requirements
* Docker version 18.06 or later
* Docker compose version 1.22 or later
* An editor or IDE
* MySQL Workbench

Note: OS recommendation - Linux Ubuntu based.

## Components
1. Nginx 1.17

## Setting up DEV environment
1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. Set another APP_SECRET for application in .env.prod file.
    
    Note 1: You can get unique secret key for example [here](http://nux.net/secret).
    
    Note 2: Do not use .env.local.php on dev and test environment (delete it if exist).
3. Add domain to local 'hosts' file:
    ```
    127.0.0.1    localhost
    ```
4. Configure `/docker/dev/xdebug.ini` (optional):
    - In case you need debug only requests with IDE KEY: PHPSTORM from frontend in your browser:
        ```
        xdebug.remote_autostart = 0
        ```
      * Install locally in Firefox extension "Xdebug helper" and set in settings IDE KEY: PHPSTORM
    - In case you need debug any request to an api (by default):
        ```
        xdebug.remote_autostart = 1
        ```
5. Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    make start
    make composer-install
    make generate-jwt-keys
    ```
6. Make sure that you have installed migrations:
    ```
    make migrate
    ```
7. In order to use this application, please open in your browser next url: [http://localhost/api/doc](http://localhost/api/doc).

## Getting shell to container
After application will start (`make start`) and in order to get shell access inside symfony container you can run following command:
```
make ssh
```
Note 1: Please use next make commands in order to enter in other containers: `make ssh-nginx`, `make ssh-supervisord`, `make ssh-mysql`.

Note 2: Please use `exit` command in order to return from container's shell to local shell.

## Building containers
In case you edited Dockerfile or other environment configuration you'll need to build containers again using next commands:
```
make stop
docker-compose build
make start
```
Note: Please use next command if you need to build prod environment `docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml build` instead `docker-compose build`.

## Start and stop environment
Please use next make commands in order to start and stop environment:
```
make start
make stop
```
Note: For prod environment need to be used next make commands: `make start-prod`, `make stop-prod`.

## Additional main command available

    make start
    make start-test
    make start-prod
    
    make stop
    make stop-test
    make stop-prod
    
    make restart
    make restart-test
    make restart-prod
    
    make env-prod
    
    make generate-jwt-keys
    
    make ssh

## Working on your project
1. For new feature development, fork `develop` branch into a new branch with one of the two patterns:
    * `feature/{ticketNo}`
2. Commit often, and write descriptive commit messages, so its easier to follow steps taken when reviewing.
3. Push this branch to the repo and create pull request into `develop` to get feedback, with the format `feature/{ticketNo}` - Short descriptive title of Jira task".
4. Iterate as needed.
5. Make sure that "All checks have passed" on CircleCI(or another one in case you are not using CircleCI) and status is green.
6. When PR is approved, it will be squashed & merged, into `develop` and later merged into `release/{No}` for deployment.
